# Research Plan

### Data Processing
- [X] Mask sea ice concentration values
- [X] Filter data to only look at the Atlantic Ocean
- [ ] Average over winter (Dec - March)
- [ ] Calculate SST anomalies
- [ ] Save processed SST as netCDF file

### Data Analysis
- [X] Calculate mean of SST
- [ ] Identify strong and weak NAO events
- [ ] Correlate SST with the NAO Index

### Visualize Data
**For all your contour plots, make sure to add a colorbar and label your x-axis, y-axis and colorbar**
- [X] Contour plot of mean SST
- [ ] Animated contour plot of SST during strong and weak NAO events
- [ ] Contour plot of SST correlated with the NAO index

### Extra Time
- [ ] Calculate standard deviation of SST
- [ ] Examine long-term trends in SST using rolling mean
